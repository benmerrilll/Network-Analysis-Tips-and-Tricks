# Network-Analysis-Tips-and-Tricks
This repo contains four notebooks that I helped create as a part of the instructional staff for a graduate course on Network Analysis at the University of Michigan. I am sharing these as an aid to my portfolio. You can also see one of my office hours for this course here[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfHZEESgb28].
